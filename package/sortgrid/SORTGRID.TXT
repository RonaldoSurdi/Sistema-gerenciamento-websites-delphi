	Well, here's my foray into the wonderful world of TStringGrid descendents. I primarily wanted the ability to click a column header and have it sort the grid by that column.  I also wanted a method to AutoSize a column.  Then I just went nuts and started throwing in everything else I could think of.  Ultimately, I made a lot of improvements to TStringGrid.

   New Procedures and Functions:
       MoveTo, Clear, InsertRow, InsertColumn, DeleteRow, DeleteColumn,
       MoveRow, MoveColumn, SwapRows, SwapColumns, AutoSizeCol,
       AutoSizeColumns, SortByColumn, IsCell, LoadFromFile, SaveToFile,
       CanUndoSort, UndoSort, GetCellDrawState, SelectCell, ValidateCell

   New Properties:
       AlignmentHorz, AlignmentVert, ClickSorting, BevelStyle, ExtendedKeys, 
       ProportionalScrollBars, Sorting (run-time only), Modified (run-time only)

   New Events:
       OnGetCellFormat, OnClickSort, OnRowInsert, OnRowDelete, OnColumnInsert,
       OnColumnDelete, OnColumnWidthsChanged, OnRowHeightsChanged, OnBeginSort,
       OnEndSort, OnSizeChanged, OnCellValidate

	When you left click a column header it ascending sorts the rows using that column as a key.  A right click does a descending sort.  The sort style defaults to automatic which means it figures out whether to do an alphabetic, numeric, or date sort depending on what type of data is in the column.

	ExtendedKeys allows you to insert and delete rows at run time with a keypress.  This defaults to False.  When True, Ctrl+Ins inserts a row, and Ctrl+Shift+Ins inserts a column.  Similarly, Ctrl+Del deletes a row, and Ctrl+Shift+Del deletes a column.

********************************************************************************
   Known Bugs/Features/Issues:

	The OnRowMoved event does NOT get called during a sort because I don't use the MoveRow function.  It was way too slow.  I copy everything out of the grid in sorted order and then put it back in.  This way is much faster (and easier to program) than a method using MoveRow.  If you need to know the final state of the grid after a sort, use the OnEndSort event.

	TSortGrid requires the two files SortGrid.Pas and SortGrid.Res.  When installed it places itself on the 'Additional' palette page.

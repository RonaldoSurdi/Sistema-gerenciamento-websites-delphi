Code formatting options:

//-------------------------------------------------------
Within the program, you have the ability to define words
that you wish to have a Bold and Color format.  For instance,
you may want to apply bold formatting to Delphi reserved
words, like "procedure", "function", "begin", "end", etc.

Select File|Keyword List to edit your list of keywords.

Right-click to invoke a popup-menu with maintenance options.
  "Add Keyword" - to add a word to the list.
  "Delete Keyword" - to delete a selected word or group of 
    words from the list.
  "Assign Color To Keyword" - to define a color for a 
    selected word or group of words.
    
   The number next to a word in the list is the integer
   value of that word's color.  0 = Black (Default value).
   
When finished, click "OK" to save your changes.
